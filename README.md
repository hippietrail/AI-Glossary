# AI-Glossary
A glossary of terminology and jargon used in Aritificial Intelligence as of late 2023.

I was unable to find an AI glossary that I considered up-to-date that included technical terms such as "byte pair encoding" and "beam search" and also non-technical terms such as "guardrails" and "doomerism".

This glossary is not intended to cover the whole history of  AI, but mainly the currently interesting fields of image generation and large language models, the concepts needed to understand them, and the main people behind them.

I don't want to plagiarize definitions. Most were written by various AI chatbots with some editing by myself. Most have Wikipedia links.

I'm not an AI expert at all. Just an old programmer who's been taking and active interest, so apologies for mistakes and ommissions. Feel free to fork and/or submit PRs.
